            I am a Technical and creative professional with over six years of experience in studio management and over 
            six years in the production of all types of digital media looking to make a change into the software engineering
            field. I am a very motivated self starter and I have deep technical expertise in the Adobe Creative 
            Suite with emphasis on video and photography programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop. 
            I have knack for learning new skills and programs that allow for the in-house creation of various types of 
            digital assets saving tens of thousands of dollars in outsourced contract fees. Presents a skill set that 
            is at the intersection of the technical and creative aspects of digital multimedia creation for brand recognition, 
            improvement, and storytelling.
